# Automated Posting to Facebook groups

Smuti Fruti freeze dried smoothies needed a solution for a free commercial.

I created a script that posts their posts into the choosen facebook groups that are stored into the excel file. If more groups are added, the script can automatically detect that and add them to the next operation.

First successful 2022-01-09

Time per one group : ~1min (shoud be improved)

Groups posted to : 31
